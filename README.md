# Attendace-system-using-facial-recognition

Attendance maintenance is an important task in all the institutions to check the performance of students. In most learning institutions, student attendances are manually taken by the use of attendance sheets issued by the department heads as part of regulation. If we choose biometric attendance system, it also wastes a lot of time as it is not automatic and also requires the involvement of the students during each class. Taking manual attendance is tedious job and time consuming so it’s preferable to find some solution that consumes less time. This led us to getting a solution of attendance system using face recognition.

The main objective of this project is to reduce manual process errors by providing semi-automated and a reliable attendance system using face recognition method with providing a valuable attendance service for both teachers and students with no involvement of students in the process. And also to increase privacy and security which student’s attendance as they cannot present his or her friend while they are not present.
